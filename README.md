<h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>I used the HTML to create the details of my project. It clearly made it possible for me to layout my work in a clean manner as well as the spacing and the indentation.</p>
  <p>Then the CSS was to style the elements in the HTML. It has allowed me to secify the positioning , the color, the size , the padding etc of my work.</p>
  <p>After creating the project I used the git tool to host my project in my GitHub account.</p>
<p>In simpler language I used
<ol>
<li<HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>GitHub </li>

<h2> Gratitude</h2>
<ol>
<li>To God for giving me the opportinity to be able to have my breath every day.</li>
<li>To all the technicall mentors who have always journeyed with me unstucking me with my difficulties.</li>
<li>The creators of Visual studio Code, Git and GitHub.</li>
<li>Developers of the HTML and the CSs languages.</li>
</ol>
